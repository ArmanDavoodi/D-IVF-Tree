# Tasks:
## Major Milestones:
    * Complete UT for CopperNode
    * Adding option for choosing clustering algorithm
    * Complete Copper Index Implementation for In memory single node single thread
    * Adding a thread pool and thread utils
## Minor Milestones:
    * Add a better sampling method when getting the approximate nearest neighbours in copper node
    * Add new UT for bufferpool
    * Code cleanup
    * Comment style
    * Implement a memory arena to check for memory leaks
    * Cleanup the Makefile and handle different flags for different builds
    * correct stackframe printing
    * testing the ANN for copper node more througly after a better implementation
## Nice for Future
    * Setting up the project to work with gdb
    * Put the created gdb cores into the ut/out/cores directory
    * Implementing Delete

## Notes:
*  Remember to check the todos.
